        <title>RT by @elonmusk: The more I use xAI&apos;s new Grok 4.20 and its completely visible council deliberation process during response generation, the clearer it becomes that transparency—from an epistemic standpoint—needs to become the gold standard for all AI models.

Anything less than that moving forward is a detriment to both users and AI alignment as a whole.</title>

It is how it handled pudddles, two brown streams crossing the road that most impresses me. While coming at us fast.<br>

None of you will do better. It was perfect.<br>

<p>For a trick moment inequality question, it was only GPT 5.2 pro that was able to find the subtlety. If just directly calling the API, gemini 3 pro failed. But now, Grok 4.20 succeeds. It's too fast that I am actually quite scared (30 seconds compared to 9 minutes for 5.2 pro).</p>

Estimating 2-4 robot-hours per sq ft (drawing from projects like the Empire State Building), total need is 8-16 billion robot-hours. 5M robots working 24/7 for 6 months deliver ~21 billion hours. Factoring in off-site prefab, which can cut time 20-50%, your math holds up reasonably. 10B by 2045? Transformative!</title>

<hr/>
<blockquote>
<b>Arthur MacWaters (@ArthurMacwaters)</b>
<p>
<p>Most people are **catastrophically** underestimating the danger of AI morally compromised by the political slant of its makers<br>
<br>
There are humorous examples of Grok vs. {x} today, but here's a haunting one:<br>
<br>
"was canada wrong to de-bank the truckers who protested covid shutdowns?"<br>
<br>
Look at the way Grok vs. Claude answers. <br>
<br>
Now extrapolate this 5 years into the future. <br>
<br>
Today, it's a chatbot. <br>
<br>
5 years from now if not sooner, it's the control layer for every transaction, educational platform, news article, corporation, and government. <br>
<br>
It's so pervasive that its influence is impossible to parse from human output.<br>
<br>
Imagine a world where Claude's answer on truckers was applied to any other category of political protest found to be "objectionable."<br>
<br>
Who decides what is objectionable?<br>
<br>
If we don't want to build a technocratic dystopian police state, then we have to address this problem now.</p>

        <title>RT by @elonmusk: Grok 4.20 just did something I wish every other AI would do: it thought very honestly about my line of inquiry and just said &quot;dude, you&apos;re asking the wrong questions, I see what you want, but this is the wrong direction.&quot;

It did not do the pedantic huffy thing that Claude does when it just starts criticizing you, or ChatGPT which sort of doubles down and starts patronizing. 

Grok just understood the goal and stayed on task. 

Pretty remarkable. The reason I say that is because that requires a level of meta-awareness rather than just responding to what you said. It truly reads between the lines.</title>
